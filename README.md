# Autonomous Path Planning and Parking Simulation  

## **Overview**  
This project explores **autonomous parking** using **path planning, obstacle detection, and motion tracking** techniques. It implements **multi-vehicle coordination** in **2D and 3D environments**, initially using **CARLA** but later optimized for lightweight **Pygame-based simulations**. The simulation provides a scalable, efficient testing framework for **autonomous vehicle navigation** in parking lots.  

## **Technologies Used**  

### **Path Planning**  
- **A* Algorithm**: Computes optimal paths while avoiding obstacles.  
- **Graph-Based Cost Calculation**: Utilizes heuristic and traversal cost functions to generate smooth parking trajectories.  
- **Cubic Spline Interpolation**: Applied to refine path smoothness, ensuring realistic vehicle motion.  

### **Motion Control & Vehicle Dynamics**  
- **Pure Pursuit Algorithm**: Implements smooth waypoint tracking, replacing the more complex **Kinematic Bicycle Model**.  
- **PID Controller**: Regulates speed and braking to ensure stable acceleration and deceleration.  

### **Sensor Simulation & Obstacle Detection**  
- **LIDAR-Based Raycasting**: Simulates real-time environment scanning, detecting obstacles dynamically.  
- **Real-Time Collision Avoidance**: The system continuously adjusts paths to prevent collisions with static and dynamic objects.  

### **Simulation Frameworks**  
- **CARLA**: Used initially for high-fidelity simulation and real-world physics integration.  
- **Pygame**: Provides a lightweight 2D simulation environment, allowing for rapid iteration and scalability.  

### **Multi-Agent Coordination**  
- **Dynamic Replanning**: Vehicles adjust their routes in response to environmental changes, ensuring efficient parking.  
- **Multi-Vehicle Navigation**: Implements coordination strategies to avoid conflicts and optimize parking lot usage.  

## **Results & Performance**  
- **Optimized A* algorithm** reduces path computation time to **<0.5s in 2D** and **~0.8s in 3D**.  
- **Obstacle detection success rate**: **99% for static obstacles, 92% for dynamic obstacles**.  
- **Multi-agent simulation** enables real-time adjustments, improving coordination efficiency.  

## **Future Enhancements**  
- **Integration with Reinforcement Learning (RL)** for adaptive decision-making.  
- **Improved 3D motion dynamics** with a refined vehicle model.  
- **Parallelized path planning** to enhance real-time response in complex environments.
